        <h2>Getting and Running ArtRay</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/haldean/artray/zipball/master">download a ZIP file</a> or <a href="https://github.com/haldean/artray">clone the Github repository</a> to
get the code. A script, <code>build.sh</code>, is provided in the distribution for building
ArtRay. It will produce an executable <code>ar</code>. The executable takes two arguments:
the input scene and the output image. Input scenes are in ArtRay format, which
is detailed below, and output images are always in PNG format. Any scene-related
options are set in the input file, and cannot be set on the command line.</p>

<h2>ArtRay format</h2>

<p><em>Note, this section will likely be out of date by the time I finish writing it.
For more up-to-date information, see the documentation distributed with ArtRay.</em></p>

<p>The ArtRay format reads like Haskell code, but is easy to understand even for
those who are unfamiliar with Haskell syntax. There are a number of <a href="https://github.com/haldean/artray/tree/master/scenes">samples</a>
distributed with the code in the <code>scenes/</code> directory. I recommend looking at
these files to understand the syntax of the format, as it's very simple.</p>

<p>The primitives in ArtRay are colors, vectors, lists and scalars; every object in
a scene is built from these. Colors are expressed as a triple of fractional
values between 0 and 1, corresponding to the red, green and blue components of
that color. Colors must be surrounded by parentheses, like so:</p>

<pre><code>background = (1, 0.5, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>That statement would set the background color to an orange (100% red, 50% green
and 0% blue).</p>

<p>Vectors are also represented by three values, but the syntax is different.
Unlike colors, they shouldn't be surrounded by parenthesis, and the numbers are
separated by spaces instead of commas. They must also be proceeded by the word
<code>Vec3</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>location = Vec3 -10 0 10
</code></pre>

<p>Lists are surrounded by square brackets, and elements in a list are separated by
commas. Newlines can also be placed between elements in lists, but are optional.
An example of a list is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>colors = [
  (0, 1, 0),
  (1, 0, 0)
]
</code></pre>

<h2>Scenes</h2>

<p>The top-level object in any scene is a <code>Scene</code>, which has five fields,
<code>background</code>, <code>options</code>, <code>geom</code>, <code>lights</code> and <code>viewer</code>, each of which are
required. The current parser requires that these fields be in order -- future
versions of ArtRay will eliminate this requirement.</p>

<h3>Scene Options</h3>

<p>An ArtRay scene has an (optionally empty) list of options in its <code>options</code>
field. At the moment there are only two options: <code>GlobalAmbient</code> and
<code>Antialiased</code>. Sample syntax is shown in the snippet below:</p>

<pre><code>options = [
  GlobalAmbient (0.4, 0.4, 0.4),
  Antialiased 4
]
</code></pre>

<p><code>GlobalAmbient</code> takes the global ambient color as it's one argument (this will
be explained further in the Lighting section below).</p>

<p>Antialiasing is done using MSAA. The <code>Antialiased</code> option takes a single
argument, which corresponds to the number of subpixels per dimension that will
be sampled, so an argument of 4 corresponds to MSAAx4, or 16 subpixels per
pixel. In general, a higher subpixel count means better antialiasing and longer
runtime.</p>

<h2>Geometry</h2>

<p>The geometry of a scene is a list of geometric primitives. ArtRay only supports
two kinds of geometric primitives: spheres and half-planes.  Each kind of
primitive has a material associated with it.</p>

<p>Spheres are defined by a center (a vector), a radius (a scalar) and a material.
The syntax for a red sphere with center (10, 0, 0) and a radius of 1 is shown
below:</p>

<pre><code>Sphere {
  center = Vec3 10 0 0,
  radius = 1.0,
  material = ColorMaterial (1, 0, 0)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Planes are defined by a vector on the plane and the normal vector of the plane.
Note that the "plane" primitive is actually a half-plane: it will only reflect
light from the side the normal points towards. This means that if you use a more
complex material for it (i.e., anything that isn't a <code>ColorMaterial</code>) only one
face will be lit correctly. To create a plane that reflects light from both
sides, add another plane to the scene with the same position vector and a
negated normal vector. The syntax for a blue yz-plane where x=8 is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Plane {
  pnorm = Vec3 -1 0 0,
  point = Vec3 8 0 0,
  material = ColorMaterial (0, 0, 1)
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Lights and Materials</h2>

<p>There are two lighting models available in ArtRay. One has no shading and no
lighting at all -- a primitive that uses this lighting model has one color over
the entire body, and is flatly shaded. To use this lighting model on a
primitive, assign a <code>ColorMaterial</code> to that primitive. <code>ColorMaterial</code> takes one
argument, which is the color of the primitive.</p>

<p>For realistic lighting, ArtRay uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model">Phong reflectance</a>. This decomposes
light and materials into three portions: specular, diffuse and ambient. ArtRay
simplifies this model somewhat -- instead of allowing each light to contribute
to ambient, there is just one global ambient applied to the scene. This is set
using the <code>GlobalAmbient</code> option described in the Options section. Each light
has two parameters: <code>speclight</code>, the specular color of the light, and
<code>difflight</code>, the diffuse color of the light. Each light also has a location
stored in the <code>loclight</code> field. <code>PhongMaterial</code>, has four fields: <code>specular</code>,
<code>diffuse</code>, <code>ambient</code>, and <code>phongexp</code>. <code>specular</code>, <code>diffuse</code> and <code>ambient</code> are
the corresponding color components of the material. <code>phongexp</code> is the Phong
exponent of the material -- this effects the size of the specular highlights on
the object. The higher the exponent, the brighter and smaller the highlights
will be. The geometry and lights sections from a scene that uses Phong lighting
is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>geom = [
  Sphere {
    center = Vec3 10.0 0.0 0.0,
    radius = 1.0,
    material = PhongMaterial {
      specular = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
      diffuse = (0.0, 0.7, 0.0),
      ambient = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
      phongexp = 4 
    } 
  }
],

lights = [
  PhongLight {
    speclight = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    difflight = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    loclight = Vec3 6.0 4.0 0.0 
  }
]
</code></pre>

<h2>Viewer</h2>

<p>The <code>Viewer</code> of the scene defines the "camera" viewing the scene. It is
parameterized by four vectors: <code>location</code>, <code>u</code>, <code>v</code> and <code>f</code>. <code>location</code> is a
vector which is the location of the imaginary camera. <code>u</code>, <code>v</code> and <code>f</code> are
slightly more difficult concepts to describe. In order to determine what in the
scene the camera can see, ArtRay simulates an actual camera of sorts. This
camera has a "focal length" <code>f</code>. In reality, <code>f</code> is a vector that points from
the camera's location to the location of the center of it's "image plane" --
think of this as the direction that the camera is looking. <code>v</code> is the vector
that points up, and it's length determines how much of the scene the camera can
see vertically. Making <code>v</code> longer means that more of the scene can be seen in
the vertical direction. <code>u</code> is the horizontal equivalent to <code>v</code>, and should be
orthogonal to <code>v</code>. Again, the longer <code>u</code> is, the more can be seen in the
horizontal direction.</p>

<p>Note that the wider you make <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, or the shorter <code>f</code> is, the more
"barrel warp" you will see in the image. If you want to see more without
distortion, you will need to move the camera itself further away from the scene.</p>
